Hi! I'm Silvi, a <b>graphic designer</b> with extensive experience in technology, currently pursuing Digital Graphic Design at <a href="https://buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/codocodo/el-programa">Da Vinci School</a>. Alongside my studies, I work independently as a designer while also teaching English at a primary school.

<i> My journey into design began at the age of 13 when I discovered 'Neopets,' an online game that allowed users to create and nurture their own pets. What fascinated me most was the ability to design webpages and engage with a social community, igniting my passion for digital design. Through this platform, I delved into HTML, JavaScript, and Photoshop, all while thoroughly enjoying the process.

In 2010, I embarked on my first YouTube channel, where I developed my skills in Illustrator, Photoshop, Sony Vegas, Premiere Pro, and Lightroom. Consequently, upon graduating high school in 2012, I was certain of my path and began studying and working as a graphic designer, a journey I've continued without pause. 

During my time living in Spain, I dedicated a year and a half to studying at <a href="https://www.42malaga.com/">42 Malaga</a>, exploring <i>Web Development</i> with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/es/tecnologiaconproposito/samsung-desarrolladoras/">Samsung Desarrolladoras</a>, <i>RPA Development</i> with <a href="https://spain.generation.org/">Generation Spain</a> and UX/UI design with <a href="https://buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/codocodo/el-programa">Codo a Codo</a>. </i>

I'm committed to continuous learning and growth, as I believe this journey is unidirectional, always pushing forward.
